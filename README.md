# File Extraction and Processing Script

This script automates the process of extracting and processing files in the current directory, focusing on `.zip` archives and files matching a SHA256 hash pattern. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

## Features
1. **ZIP File Extraction**:
   - The script searches for `.zip` files in the current directory.
   - Attempts to extract the contents using the password `infected`.
   - Continues processing the extracted files.

2. **SHA256 File Processing**:
   - Searches for files with names matching a SHA256 hash pattern (64 hexadecimal characters).
   - For each matching file:
     - Extracts the file using `pyinstxtractor.py`.
     - Deletes the original SHA256 file to keep the directory clean.
     - Checks the extracted directory for `.pyc` files.
     - Filters `.pyc` files, excluding those starting with `pyi` or named `struct`.
     - Copies valid `.pyc` files to the current directory for further analysis.

3. **Robust Handling**:
   - Verifies the existence of extracted directories before proceeding with file checks.
   - Provides detailed logs to track the script's progress and actions.

## Usage
Run the script in a directory containing `.zip` files or files matching a SHA256 hash pattern. The script will handle the rest, extracting, cleaning, and organizing files as needed.

This tool is designed to streamline the processing of potentially large and complex datasets, especially for reverse engineering or malware analysis tasks.
